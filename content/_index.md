        Hello, my name is Jihyeon Hwang. Iâ€™m a senior undergraduate student at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST).

        During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Kyuho Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/kyuhojsnlee/) and wonderful team [Intelligent Systems Lab (ISL)](https://www.isl-yonsei.ac/). My research focused on hardware accelerator design and HW-SW co-design for automotive driving and computer vision.

        Also I am an AI Engineer at [Muscle SYNC](https://www.musclesync.co.kr/home), a startup developing a sensorless muscle activation analysis service based on computer vision AI. Founded with teammates I met at a hackathon, we are building an innovative product that redefines how muscle engagement is analyzed â€” without the need for physical sensors. My research in digital SoC was driven by the need I experienced while developing products at Muscle SYNC â€” the need for seamless hardware-software optimization.

        Nowadays, I've been working on LLM agent research and human avatar modeling. These projects reflect my broader goal of being engineer that can advantage human through technologies.

        I am always happy to chat about various research fields. Feel free to reach out to collaborate!
